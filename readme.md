# DAO TODO LIST

1. Relaunch BPT for ve8020 locking mechanism, with updated configurations to still be permanently yield-bearing, but not inclusive of another CSP-BPT. 80NFTE/20rETH to be used for obtaining veNFTE which will be the primary focus of all platform stakeholders. The NFTFi and LSDFi Vaults will distribute revenue to lockers pro-rata their share of veNFTE - dynamic, vote-escrowed 80/20 LP.
